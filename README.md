# Neuromorphic-Computation
This repo compares ANN-to-SNN conversion and native SNN training on MNIST using PyTorch/snnTorch. Evaluates accuracy, latency, spikes, and dynamics. Includes visualization tools for spikes, training, and weights. Active researchâ€”results may evolve. Goals: optimize SNNs for neuromorphic hardware.
